My academic journey has been loaded with uncertainty, fear, hope, stress, mentorship, and mentoring, and most importantly growth. \n\nThe path for me as a nontraditional student started at age 20 as a Lance Corporal in the Marine Corps beginning at a community college. After nine straight semesters of taking courses part time I transferred to Brown where in three years I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finished my Bachelors in Computer Science with an additional focus in Economics. Brown has pushed me to grow in so many ways and given me the opportunity to earn an extremely well rounded education both within my concentration as well as develop a generalized skill of critical thinking. Throughout my time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve trained Neural Networks, built full stack applications, learned models for the stock market, evaluated balance sheets, observed planets through telescopes, studied abroad in South Korea, went on a mission trip to Peru, and wrote a few good papers on the Lewis turning point in development economics of East Asian countries. \n\nI could not be more thankful for the time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had and the education I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received and most of all for the many people who have supported me along the way."
